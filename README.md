# The Rules of Life Engine

A nontechnical description of the project (Part 1), which explains the projects significance and importance. This description also serves as a public justification for NSF funding by articulating how the project serves the national interest, as stated by NSFs mission. This part of the abstract should describe the fundamental issues the project seeks to address, as well as other potential benefits, such as how the project advances the field, supports education and diversity, or benefits society. This part should be understandable by a broad audience. 

Our proposed Rules of Life Engine (RoLE) model will be a mechanistic, simulation-based hypothesis-testing and data synthesis framework, enabling scientists with multi-dimensional biodiversity data to generate and test parameterized hypotheses about the processes driving biodiversity patterns in their system and across systems. We will new techniques in machine learning to fit models to high dimensional, cross-scale data. The model will simulate eco-evolutionary community assembly building from individual-based ecological and genetic neutral models with added non-neutral, trait-based competition and environmental filtering. New species and traits will arise through long time scale evolution in the metacommunity and rapid evolution in the local community. Population genetics and species abundances in the local community will be modeled through birth, death, immigration, and mutation. We will refine and illustrate the use of the RoLE model by testing four hypothesized rules of life across three biogeographic systems for which multi-scale biodiversity data are now available. The hypotheses address the relative roles of immigration versus speciation in community assembly, how species interactions influence diversity, how different assembly histories determine the strength of species interactions, and whether/how systems come to equilibrium. We have established a network of 14 collaborators (including the National Ecological Observatory Network) who will use the RoLE model in their diverse systems and propagate wider adoption. In order to further reduce barriers to use, we will develop a Shiny app interface that creates containerized workflows. Output research objects with standardized metadata will promote reproducibility and sharing. Our RoLE model framework will be made available as open source software that promotes engagement by researchers across computational skill levels. The insights gained from our RoLE model are of direct relevance to conservation, e.g., whether or not communities are assembled primarily by in situ evolution or ex situ immigration strongly determines their response to anthropogenic pressures and optimal conservation management. To lower the barrier to entry into quantitative biodiversity research we will develop a massively open online course through the Santa Fe Institute's Complexity Explorer program and use the RoLE model as an interactive teaching tool to help students gain deep understanding of competitive coexistence theory, neutral ecological theory, and population genetic theory. In conjunction with Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, we will also provide an in-person data science training workshop followed by a hackathon to explore novel computational needs in the biodiversity informatics community.
